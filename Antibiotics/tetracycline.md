> Tetracycline is an oral antibiotic in the tetracyclines family of medications, used to treat a number of infections, including acne, cholera, brucellosis, plague, malaria, and syphilis.
> 
> Tetracyclines are growth inhibitors ([bacteriostatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriostatic "Bacteriostatic")) rather than killers of the infectious agent ([bacteriocidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriocidal "Bacteriocidal")) and are only effective against multiplying microorganisms. They are short-acting and passively diffuse through [porin channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porin_(protein) "Porin (protein)") in the bacterial membrane. They inhibit [protein synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_synthesis "Protein synthesis") by binding reversibly to the bacterial [30S ribosomal subunit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30S_ribosomal_subunit "30S ribosomal subunit") and preventing the [aminoacyl tRNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminoacyl_tRNA "Aminoacyl tRNA") from binding to the A site of the ribosome. They also bind to some extent the bacterial [50S ribosomal subunit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50S_ribosomal_subunit "50S ribosomal subunit") and may alter the [cytoplasmic membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasmic_membrane "Cytoplasmic membrane") causing [intracellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular "Intracellular") components to leak from bacterial cells.

> Tetracyclines all have the same antibacterial spectrum, although there are differences in species' sensitivity to types of tetracyclines. Tetracyclines inhibit protein synthesis in both bacterial and human cells. Bacteria have a system that allows tetracyclines to be transported into the cell, whereas human cells do not. Human cells therefore are spared the effects of tetracycline on protein synthesis.
