# iGEM-research
This repository hosts my research for the [iGEM 2024](https://igem.org/) [ResiSense](https://resisense.github.io/) project.  

# Source Control
The repository is expected to be mirrored to other locations, but the one hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/CCheukKa/iGEM-research) should always be treated as ***the authoritative source***. For source control reasons, this repository is kept read-only for everyone except myself.  
***For the best link traversal and rendering experience, viewers are recommended to browse the catalogue on [GitHub](https://github.com/CCheukKa/iGEM-research).***

# Workflow
This repository is usually cloned to my local Google Drive mount (for ease of sharing) and edited using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).
