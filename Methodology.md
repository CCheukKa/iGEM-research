## Preface
As per the [prime candidates](Methicillin%20resistance/genes/genes%20involved.md#Prime%20candidates) of the [genes involved](Methicillin%20resistance/genes/genes%20involved.md), [mecA](Methicillin%20resistance/genes/mecA%20gene%20(PBP2a).md) and [femA](Methicillin%20resistance/genes/femA%20gene.md) will be selected for detection.
From [MRSA genome comparison](Methicillin%20resistance/DNA%20sequences/MRSA%20genome%20comparison.md), we found that the gene sequence is specific enough that virtually any 15bp detection site would yield a unique match throughout the entire genome.

## Strategies
There are currently 2 proposed [methicillin resistance](Methicillin%20resistance/Genomic%20basis%20for%20methicillin%20resistance.md) detection strategies.
1. Construct 2 separate DNA-zymes each responsible for individually detecting [mecA](Methicillin%20resistance/DNA%20sequences/mecA%20sequence.md) and [femA](Methicillin%20resistance/DNA%20sequences/femA%20sequence.md). The results would then be manually *and*'d together to produce a verdict.
2. Construct 1(+) DNA-zyme(s) with one binding site
