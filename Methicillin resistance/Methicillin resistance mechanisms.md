#### Hydrolysis
Methicillin is a [beta-lactam antibiotic](../Antibiotics/beta-lactam.md) which is not hydrolysed by small quantities of staphylococcal penicillinase. However, producers of high amount of penicillinase tend to resist the effect of methicillin through partial hydrolysis of the antibiotic, making the susceptibility of the strain to methicillin borderline between susceptible and resistant.

#### Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) alterations
[Penicillin-binding protein (PBP)](Penicillin-binding%20protein%20(PBP).md)
Another mechanism of borderline methicillin resistance involves the alterations of [penicillin-binding proteins](Penicillin-binding%20protein%20(PBP).md) (PBPs), the peptidoglycan synthesis enzymes. SA has at least four different PBPs, designated PBP1-4, and they are the targets of beta-lactam antibiotics. A decrease in the penicillin-binding affinities of the PBPs *(=> penicillin less effective)*, an increase in the production of PBPs *(=> decrease penicillin effective concentration)*, or a combination of both are considered to account for some cases of raised resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics.
Tomasz et al. reported the clinical strains associated with decreased penicillin-binding affinities of PBP1 or PBP3 and increased production of PBP4. MICs of methicillin to these clinical strains and also to those producing an excessive amount of penicillinase increase only marginally compared to that of susceptible SA strains.

#### PBP2a + ..?
[genes involved](genes/genes%20involved.md)
However, the most significant and most prevalent mechanism of methicillin resistance is associated with the acquisition of the additional PBP, designated PBP2, by staphylococci. ([PBP2a](genes/mecA%20gene%20(PBP2a).md))
mecA effectiveness depends on strain since another factor ([femA gene](genes/femA%20gene.md)) is necessary for the degree of methicillin resistance ([source](https://journals.asm.org/doi/epdf/10.1128/jb.173.11.3507-3513.1991) **(tl;dr)** -> *something about colonies forming groups with varying resistance levels*)
! there are at least 23 known auxiliary genes for this mechanism ([source](https://journals.asm.org/doi/epdf/10.1128/aac.38.11.2590))
