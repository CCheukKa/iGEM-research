! there are at least 23 known auxiliary genes for this mechanism ([source](https://journals.asm.org/doi/epdf/10.1128/aac.38.11.2590))

## Prime candidates
#### methicillin resistance:
-> [mecA gene (PBP2a)](mecA%20gene%20(PBP2a).md)
- the main thing
- relatively short (720bp)
- is a combination of 2 other genes (not 100%)
#### methicillin resistance factor:
-> [femA gene](femA%20gene.md)
- the main factor (seems to be quite important*)
- very long (1263bp)


## just no
#### methicillin resistance protein:
-> [FmtA Is a d-Amino Esterase That Acts on Teichoic Acids](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.02070-15#sec-2)
- act on teichoic acid to facilitate cell division
    - *not enough research currently*
- can help facilitate resistance indirectly
#### methicillin resistance determinant protein:
-> [methicillin resistance determinant protein FmhA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3919715)
- *very not enough research currently*
