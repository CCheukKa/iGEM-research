*More than 90%* of the methicillin-resistance clinical staphylococcal strains share a common feature of carrying the mecA gene.
Introduction of the mecA gene confers methicillin resistance on MSSA strains, and transposon mutagenesis of the gene renders highly methicillin-resistant SA strains susceptible to methicillin.
*The mecA gene is known to be widely distributed in the species of genus Staphylococcus*, including MRSA and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRC-NS), *but it has not been found in any other genus of bacteria.*

# [Mechanism](Methicillin%20resistance%20mechanisms.md)
The mecA gene codes for PBP2', a penicillin-binding protein with low binding affinities to practically all [beta-lactam antibiotics](beta-lactam%20antibiotics.md) clinically available today.

# Homology
Nucleotide sequencing study has revealed that *the gene is composed of two regions having homology to two distinct genes*; the 5' region of the gene has homology to the penicillinase gene (blaZ) of SA, and the rest of the gene has homology to E Coli PBPs2 and 3.

The presence of the mecA gene is considered to be the hallmark for the identification of MRSA in clinical laboratories, and PCR detection methods of mecA gene have been developed for this purpose by several researchers.
