### Lack of legislation and consequence
> **Health personnel in rural settings without the capacity to do AMR testing** have difficulty to decide on the choice of antimicrobial in the absence of an antimicrobial sensitivity test. As a result, **health professionals use more and more broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat infections caused by several bacteria species** or those for which establishing the aetiology is difficult or takes a long time.
> Some health professionals issue prescriptions that are **not evidence-based** and **rely on a syndromic approach** to both infections in the community and hospitalised patients.

- Inappropriate antimicrobial prescriptions (high patient-to-doctor ratio)
    - 52% incorrect dose
    - 63.7% incorrect duration
- Lacking drug quality
- Prevalence of over-the-counter drugs

### Agriculture
> A strong association between agricultural use of antimicrobials and the development of resistance has been suggested, and it has been shown that the bulk of antimicrobials used worldwide are not consumed by humans but rather are given to animals for the purposes of food production.
- Multidrug resistant bacteria in produce
